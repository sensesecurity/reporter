A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

### Issues
## [H-01] Guaranteed Reward Acquisition and Loss Avoidance via Rebase Transaction Sandwiching
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/Router.sol#L298-L305
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L798-L802

## Type of Issue:
MEV

## Description:
The `StakeTogether` smart contract's rebasing mechanism is susceptible to exploitation through a sandwich attack around the time of rebase. The contract's `processStakeRewards` function is designed to distribute rewards based on the current shares, and the `setBeaconBalance` function adjusts the beacon balance in the event of a loss, withdrawal, or refund. An attacker can manipulate this mechanism by making a substantial deposit just before the rebase transaction is mined, thereby increasing their share count temporarily. When the rebase occurs, if there is a profit, the attacker's shares receive a portion of the rewards disproportionate to their actual stake in the pool. Following the rebase, the attacker can withdraw the entire balance, including the rewards, before any loss is reported or processed. The attacker can also perform the opposite operation to avoid losses.

## Impact:
This attack allows an individual to capture a significant portion of the rewards by timing deposits and withdrawals around the rebase event, which is intended to distribute profits or account for losses among all stakers fairly. The attacker's actions can lead to honest participants receiving a smaller share of the profits or bearing a larger share of the losses.


## POC:
Guaranteed reward:
1. Attacker monitors the mempool for an upcoming rebase transaction that reports profit.
2. Attacker submits a transaction with a higher gas fee to deposit a large amount of ETH just before the rebase transaction is confirmed.
3. Rebase occurs, and rewards are distributed, with the attacker receiving a disproportionate amount due to the large, last-minute deposit.
4. Attacker immediately submits another transaction to withdraw the entire balance, including the newly acquired rewards.
5. The attacker repeats this process, exploiting the timing of the rebase to maximize rewards.

Avoid loss:
1. Attacker monitors the mempool for an upcoming rebase transaction that reports loss.
2. Attacker submits a transaction with a higher gas fee to withdraw his balance just before the rebase transaction is confirmed.
3. Rebase occurs, and the loss is socialized to the other stakers, with the attacker being safe from the loss due to the last-minute withdrawal.
4. Attacker then submits another transaction to re-deposit his funds.
5. The attacker repeats this process, exploiting the timing of the rebase avoid losses.

## Recommendations:
- Implement a lock-up period for deposited funds around the time of a rebase to prevent deposits and withdrawals within a certain window before and after a rebase occurs.
- Consider a dynamic fee structure where fees for withdrawals post-rebase are adjusted based on the time since the last deposit to discourage quick deposits and withdrawals around rebases.

## Resolution:
The situation can happen on a specific edge case where the Circuit Breaker have a reduced interval and Liquidity is less than 32 ETH on Stake Together Contract.

This don't affect the ethereum on Beacon Chain, only on Smart Contract for Pool Withdrawal, all ethereum above 32 ETH it's moved to Beacon Chain.

The resolution for this is the implementation of the withdrawBlock that adds a delay to withdrawals after each deposit, 7200 blocks, about 1 day after each deposit.

We implemented the withdrawBeaconBlock that adds other delay of 7200 blocks for Beacon Withdrawal after with beacon withdrawal.

The protocol have a entry fee that demotivate this kind of action, because the operation should be done on specific range to be profitable.


## [M-01] Attacker Capable of Disrupting Preventing Deposits and Withdrawals for a Day with a 3 ETH Cost
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L358-L361
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L399-L411

## Type of Issue:
Logic

## Description:
The `StakeTogether` contract is exposed to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to its daily deposit and withdrawal limits. An attacker can exploit this by using a flash loan to deposit an amount equal to the daily limit, which is set at 1000 ETH in the test-suite, and then immediately withdrawing it. This action would exhaust the daily limit for deposits and withdrawals, preventing other users from performing these actions until the limit resets the next day.

## Impact:
This issue can be exploited at a relatively low cost to the attacker, especially considering the potential impact. By locking out all deposits and withdrawals for a day, the attacker can cause significant disruption to the protocol's operations. This could lead to a loss of trust in the system, as users would be unable to access their funds or receive expected rewards for an entire day, which in the world of decentralized finance is a considerable amount of time.

## POC:
### Attack steps
1. Attacker takes out a flash loan for 1000 ETH and 3 ETH of his funds to cover for the fees.
2. Attacker deposits the 1000 ETH into the StakeTogether contract.
3. The `_depositBase` function updates `totalDeposited` to reflect the new deposit, reaching the daily deposit limit.
4. Attacker immediately initiates a withdrawal of the same amount and repays the flash loan with the withdrawal + his 3 ETH fees.
5. The `_withdrawBase` function updates `totalWithdrawnPool` or `totalWithdrawnValidator`, depending on the withdrawal type, potentially reaching the daily withdrawal limit.
6. As both the deposit and withdrawal limits for the day have been reached, no other users can deposit or withdraw funds until the next day when the limits reset.

### Coded PoC
```javascript
describe('DOS', function () {
    it('prevent deposits and withdrawals', async function () {
        const poolAddress = user3.address
        const referral = user4.address
        await stakeTogether.connect(owner).addPool(poolAddress, true, false)

        const AttackerEtherBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(user1.address);

        const user1DepositAmount = ethers.parseEther('1000')
        const tx1 = await stakeTogether
            .connect(user1)
            .depositPool(poolAddress, referral, { value: user1DepositAmount })
        await tx1.wait()

        const amountToWithdrawAttacker = await stakeTogether.connect(user1).balanceOf(user1.address)

        const tx2 = await stakeTogether
            .connect(user1)
            .withdrawPool(amountToWithdrawAttacker, poolAddress)
        await tx2.wait()

        const AttackerEtherAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(user1.address);

        const user2DepositAmount = ethers.parseEther('10')

        await expect(
            stakeTogether.connect(user2).depositPool(poolAddress, referral, { value: user2DepositAmount }),
            ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(stakeTogether, 'DepositLimitReached')
        const balanceToWithdraw = await stakeTogether.connect(user2).balanceOf(user2);
        console.log("-------------------------------")
        console.log("Cost = %d  ETH", ethers.formatUnits(AttackerEtherAfter - AttackerEtherBefore))

    })
})
```

## Recommendations:
- Consider adding block number based restriction which prevents deposits and withdrawals in the same block to prevent flashloan attacks.

## Resolution:
The withdrawBeaconBlock was implemented, which sets the beacon withdrawal delay to 7200 blocks, about 1 day. There is also an entry fee.

## [M-02] User withdrawals funds may be locked for extended period of time
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L419-L426
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/Router.sol#L277-L404
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/Withdrawals.sol#L176-L184

## Type of Issue:
Temporary freezing of user funds

## Description:
The Withdrawals system lacks a mechanism for fair distribution of withdrawal funds to the users. Currently anyone possessing `stwETH` can withdraw money from validator exit queue, no matter how long they hold it. It means that users funds can be front-run or grieved unintentionally. High demand for withdrawals could block users from getting their ETH, for extended periods of time. To ensure access, users have to time the withdrawal with report execution and use inflated gas prices, turning withdrawal into a costly race.

An attacker could also exploit lack of a withdrawal queue by monitoring router transactions to the Withdrawals address, inserting a deposit, and then a withdrawal via `withdrawValidator()`. This could drain the contract's ETH, hindering other users from withdrawing.

## Impact:
1. Users may be involved in gas auctions, overbidding gas prices to get their withdrawal executed before others to get their funds.
2. User may not be able to retrieve their funds from beacon chain withdrawal for extended periods of time.

## POC:
When a user wants to withdraw bigger amount that currently is stored in the pool, they have to call [StakeTogether.withdrawValidator()](https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L419-L426):
```solidity
  function withdrawValidator(uint256 _amount, address _pool) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (!config.feature.WithdrawValidator) revert FeatureDisabled();
    if (_amount <= address(this).balance) revert WithdrawFromPool();
    if (_amount + withdrawBalance > beaconBalance) revert InsufficientBeaconBalance();
    _withdrawBase(_amount, WithdrawType.Validator, _pool);
    _setWithdrawBalance(withdrawBalance + _amount);
    withdrawals.mint(msg.sender, _amount);
  }
```
This function mints `stwETH` for the user, which is reedemable 1:1 with the Ether stored in `Withdrawals` contract.

This triggers an off-chain process of withdrawing validator stake from Beacon chain. Withdrawal credentials are all set to `Router` contract and when the oracles execute a report with `withdrawAmount`, it is sent to `Withdrawals` contract:
```solidity
  function executeReport(Report calldata _report) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused activeReportOracle {
    ...
    if (_report.withdrawAmount > 0) {
      stakeTogether.setWithdrawBalance(stakeTogether.withdrawBalance() - _report.withdrawAmount);
      withdrawals.receiveWithdrawEther{ value: _report.withdrawAmount }();
    }
```

Then, users can withdraw Ether for `stwETH`:
[Withdrawals.withdraw()](https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/Withdrawals.sol#L176-L184)
```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    if (stakeTogether.isListedInAntiFraud(msg.sender)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    if (address(this).balance < _amount) revert InsufficientEthBalance();
    if (balanceOf(msg.sender) < _amount) revert InsufficientStwBalance();
    if (_amount <= 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _amount);
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);
  }
```

Because user is minted `stwETH` immediately when calling `StakeTogether.withdrawValidator()`, they can completely skip waiting period before withdrawal funds are sent from `Router` contract and withdraw the funds immediately, if `Withdrawals` has any Ether balance.

## Recommendations:
Either consider add priority queue for withdrawals, or introduce withdrawals delay period for an account to minimize the risk of withdrawals racing.

## Resolution:
Risk for pauseable contracts. In the worst-case scenario, he can upgrade the contract. There's not much that can be done. Adding this emergency exit implementation could be a risk.

## [M-03] Protocol fees can be set up to 100% stealing from the stakers 
## Links:

https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L732

## Type of Issue:
Centralization Risk

## Description:
The `setFee` function is used to configure protocol fees, ensuring that the total allocation percentages equal 100%. However, it currently allows for the possibility that the owner could have their fee set to 100%. This could result in a situation where they set the fee to 100% and steal funds from users.
```javascript


function setFee(
    FeeType _feeType,
    uint256 _value,
    uint256[] calldata _allocations
) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
  if (_allocations.length != 4) revert InvalidLength();
  uint256 sum = 0;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allocations.length; i++) {
    fees[_feeType].allocations[FeeRole(i)] = _allocations[i];
    sum += _allocations[i];
  }

  if (sum != 1 ether) revert InvalidSum();

  fees[_feeType].value = _value;

  emit SetFee(_feeType, _value, _allocations);
}
```

## Recommendations:

Introduce a maximum threshold for the fee. This would prevent setting their fee to an extremely high value.

```diff


function setFee(
    FeeType _feeType,
    uint256 _value,
    uint256[] calldata _allocations
) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
+ if (_value > 1000) revert FeeTooHigh();
  if (_allocations.length != 4) revert InvalidLength();
  uint256 sum = 0;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < _allocations.length; i++) {
    fees[_feeType].allocations[FeeRole(i)] = _allocations[i];
    sum += _allocations[i];
  }

  if (sum != 1 ether) revert InvalidSum();

  fees[_feeType].value = _value;

  emit SetFee(_feeType, _value, _allocations);
}
```

## Resolution:
if someone has the wrong config, it can cause problems, nothing has been done about it

## [M-04] Malicious `airdropFee` user can bypass the `Airdrop.claim()` to transfer shares to any user address
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/Airdrop.sol#L145
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L679-L686

## Type of Issue:
Centralization Risk 

## Description:
In the existing setup, the `Airdrop.claim()` function invokes `stakeTogether.claimAirdrop()`, which includes a crucial check to validate `msg.sender == airdropFee` (as defined by the `FeeRole.Airdrop`). However, a concerning security flaw emerges as the `airdropFee` can be altered to any address via the `setFeeAddress` function by the `ADMIN_ROLE` user.

This vulnerability opens the door to potential abuse, enabling the new user with control over the `airdropFee` to manipulate the airdrop process. This manipulation can lead to unauthorized share transfers to users who are not part of the intended merkle proof recipients. Given that airdrops occur periodically, addressing this issue is paramount to maintaining the integrity and security of the system."

## Impact:
The `airdropFee` has the ability to bypass the `Airdrop.claim()` process and the Merkle Proof, allowing it to transfer shares to any users as desired.

## POC:
Place the test in `Airdrop.test.ts`
```javascript
it('FeeRole.Airdrop account can bypass Airdrop.claimAirdrop to mint shares to any users', async function () {

      //The Setup
      const AirdropFactory = new Airdrop__factory().connect(owner)
      const airdrop2 = await upgrades.deployProxy(AirdropFactory)
      await airdrop2.waitForDeployment()
      const airdropContract2 = airdrop2 as unknown as Airdrop
      const AIR_ADMIN_ROLE = await airdropContract2.ADMIN_ROLE()
      await airdropContract2.connect(owner).grantRole(AIR_ADMIN_ROLE, owner)
      await airdropContract2.connect(owner).setStakeTogether(mockStakeTogetherProxy)
      await airdropContract2.connect(owner).setRouter(owner.address)

      const user1DepositAmount = ethers.parseEther('100')
      const poolAddress = user3.address
      const referral = user4.address
      await mockStakeTogether.connect(owner).addPool(poolAddress, true, false)

      //Set the user5.address as the FeeRole.Airdrop
      await mockStakeTogether.setFeeAddress(0, user5.address);

      const tx1 = await mockStakeTogether
        .connect(user1)
        .depositPool(poolAddress, referral, { value: user1DepositAmount })
      await tx1.wait()

      expect(await mockStakeTogether.shares(user2.address)).to.equal(0)

      //user5 calls the claimAirdrop directly to bypass the function
      await mockStakeTogether.connect(user5).claimAirdrop(user2.address, ethers.parseEther('0.1'))

      expect(await mockStakeTogether.shares(user2.address)).to.equal(ethers.parseEther('0.1'))
    })
```

## Recommendations:
To prevent direct calls to `claimAirdrop` through the StakeTogether contract, a protective measure should be implemented. Please include the following check: `if (msg.sender != address(Airdrop)) revert OnlyAirdropCanBeTheCaller();`. After this fix, the `claimAirdrop` function should appear as follows:

The Fix:
```diff
  /// @notice Function to claim rewards by transferring shares, accessible only by the airdrop fee address.
  /// @param _account Address to transfer the claimed rewards to.
  /// @param _sharesAmount Amount of shares to claim as rewards.
  function claimAirdrop(address _account, uint256 _sharesAmount) external whenNotPaused {
+    if (msg.sender != address(Airdrop)) revert OnlyAirdropCanBeTheCaller();
    address airdropFee = getFeeAddress(FeeRole.Airdrop);
    _transferShares(airdropFee, _account, _sharesAmount);
  }
```

## Resolution:

## [M-05] Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) Risk Due to `transferExtraAmount()` Underflow in `StakeTogetherWrapper.sol`
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogetherWrapper.sol#L79

## Type of Issue:
DOS

## Description:
The `StakeTogetherWrapper.sol` contract facilitates the exchange of stpETH to wstpETH and vice versa, while avoiding direct ether transactions. Within this context, the `transferExtraAmount()` function is designed as a helpful tool for transferring ether in the contract to the `stakeTogetherFee` address. However, a potential issue arises due to the code at [this location](https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogetherWrapper.sol#L79), which can lead to an overflow condition.

Two scenarios further illustrate the issue:

1. When the contract holds a balance of 50 ether and the `totalSupply()` of wstpETH is 25 ether, only half (25 ether) is transferred to the `stakeTogetherFee` address. The disposition of the remaining 25 ether is ambiguous.

2. In a scenario where the `totalSupply()` of wstpETH exceeds the ether balance, the `transferExtraAmount()` function is at risk of failing due to an underflow. For instance, if the contract's ether balance is 10 ether, but the `totalSupply()` of wstpETH is 25 ether, this condition would trigger an underflow issue.

These scenarios highlight potential concerns related to the proper handling of ether transfers within the contract.

## Impact:
The ether sent to the `StakeTogetherWrapper.sol` contract cannot be retrieved under any circumstances.

## POC:

Place the test in `StakeTogetherWrapper.test.ts`

```javascript
it('admin cannot transfer the native ether to stakeTogetherFee address', async function () {
      // Setup the Pool and wrap to stpETH to wstpETH
      const user1DepositAmount = ethers.parseEther('100')
      const poolAddress = user3.address
      const referral = user4.address
      await stakeTogether.connect(owner).addPool(poolAddress, true, false)

      await stakeTogether.connect(user1).depositPool(poolAddress, referral, { value: user1DepositAmount })

      const user1StpETH = await stakeTogether.balanceOf(user1.address)
  
      await stakeTogether.connect(user1).approve(stakeTogetherWrapperProxy, user1StpETH)

      const tx = await stakeTogetherWrapper.connect(user1).wrap(user1StpETH)
      await tx.wait()

      const user1WstpETH = await stakeTogetherWrapper.balanceOf(user1.address)
      expect(user1WstpETH).to.equal(user1StpETH) // Checks if wstpETH balance is equal to the stpETH balance

      //User sends ether to the contact by mistake
      await user1.sendTransaction({
        to: stakeTogetherWrapperProxy,
        value: ethers.parseEther('20.0'),
      })

      // admin tries to send the extra ether to the stakeTogetherFee but fails due to underflow!!!
      // 0x11 is PANIC code for overflow / underflow scenarios
      await expect(stakeTogetherWrapper.connect(owner).transferExtraAmount()).to.be.revertedWithPanic("0x11")
    })
```


## Recommendations:

The `transferExtraAmount()` function in `StakeTogetherWrapper.sol` should send `address(this).balance` instead of `address(this).balance - totalSupply()`.

The Fix:
```diff
  /// @notice Transfers any extra amount of ETH in the contract to the StakeTogether fee address.
  /// @dev Only callable by the admin role. Requires that extra amount exists in the contract balance.
  function transferExtraAmount() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
-    uint256 extraAmount = address(this).balance - totalSupply();
+    uint256 extraAmount = address(this).balance;
    if (extraAmount <= 0) revert NoExtraAmountAvailable();
    address stakeTogetherFee = stakeTogether.getFeeAddress(IStakeTogether.FeeRole.StakeTogether);
    payable(stakeTogetherFee).transfer(extraAmount);
  }

## Type of Issue:
Logical bug

## Description:
Apart from adding and removing report oracles, there is also a possibility to blacklist them, which changes `totalReportOracles`  storage variable which is then used in report submission and execution to check if the quorum is reached:
```solidity
  function blacklistReportOracle(address _account) external onlyRole(ORACLE_SENTINEL_ROLE) {
    if (!reportOracles[_account]) revert OracleNotExists(); // @audit missing check if already blacklisted
    reportOraclesBlacklist[_account] = true;
    if (totalReportOracles > 0) {
      totalReportOracles--;
    }
    emit BlacklistReportOracle(_account);
  }

   function isReadyToSubmit(Report calldata _report) public view returns (bytes32) {
    bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encode(_report));
    if (totalReportOracles < config.oracleQuorum) revert QuorumNotReached();
    ...
  }
```

There is a missing check in `blacklistReportOracle()` allowing the same address to be added to a blacklist multiple times, each time decreasing `totalReportOracles`. This cannot be corrected, because such a check exists in `unBlacklistReportOracle()`. The only way to work around this issue is to add more oracles.

Additionally, if an oracle is blacklisted and then removed, `totalReportOracles` is decreased twice, even though a single oracle was disabled.

The worst case scenation, however is forcing oracle consensus to fail. Because `totalReportOracles` is diminished by too big amount, the value of `votesBeforeThreshold` inside `Router.submitReport()` will be lower than expected, allowing minority to fail a consensus against the desired logic:

```solidity
      uint256 votesBeforeThreshold = totalReportOracles - config.reportNoConsensusMargin;
      ...
      if (
        totalVotes[reportBlock] >= votesBeforeThreshold &&
        reportVotesForBlock[reportBlock][hash] < config.oracleQuorum
      ) {
        emit ConsensusFail(reportBlock, _report, hash);
        _advanceNextReportBlock();
      }
```

As confirmed with the project, adding and removing oracles is managed by multi-sig with 7 days delay period. That means that a single compromised oracle can halt rewards distribution for 7 days. Delaying the report settlement may have an additional negative impact on the protocol - not distributing rewards or losses will make the actual value of stpETH to go stale, while the real value can be calculated because validators earning on the beacon chain are public. When the rebase will finally be settled, it may give an opportunity for MEV manipulating compounded stpETH value change, harming the reward mechanism.

## Impact:
Both backlisting and then removing an oracle and blacklisting the same oracle multiple times will unexpectedly decrease `totalReportOracles` storage variable used in reporting quorum calculations. In such case `totalReportOracles` may drop below `config.oracleQuorum`, making it impossible to reach a quorum on report until new oracles are added. In case that `config.reportNoConsensusMargin` is set, it can drop below set value, having the same result. This may result in minority of malicious oracles - in extreme case even one - to fail the consensus, postponing report execution to the next epoch.

## POC:
Because both blacklisting and then removing and blacklisting multiple times 
1. There are 4 report oracles and following are set
`totalReportOracles = 4`
`config.reportNoConsensusMargin = 1`
`config.oracleQuorum = 3`
2. One oracle gets blacklisted twice or balcklisted and then removed. A new oracle is added in its place.
`totalReportOracles = 3`
`votesBeforeThreshold = totalReportOracles - config.reportNoConsensusMargin => 3 - 1 => 2`
4. One valid and one malicious vote suffices for this condition to be true: 
```solidity
totalVotes[reportBlock] >= votesBeforeThreshold &&
        reportVotesForBlock[reportBlock][hash] < config.oracleQuorum
```
This allows single malicious oracle to force consensus failure and postpone execution to the next block.


## Recommendations:
1. In the function `Report.blacklistReportOracle()` add a check similar to one from `unBlacklistReportOracle()` to make sure that the same oracle cannot be blacklisted twice:

```diff
  function blacklistReportOracle(address _account) external onlyRole(ORACLE_SENTINEL_ROLE) {
    if (!reportOracles[_account]) revert OracleNotExists();
    reportOraclesBlacklist[_account] = true;
+   if (reportOraclesBlacklist[_account]) revert OracleAlreadyBlacklisted();
    if (totalReportOracles > 0) {
      totalReportOracles--;
    }
    emit BlacklistReportOracle(_account);
  }
```

2. Consider removing oracle blacklisting and use adding/removing functionality instead. This will prevent `totalReportOracles` to be decreased twice.

## [L-01] Centralization risks
# Centralization risks
Ethereum Liquid Staking Protocols require trusted actors due to the multiple crucial sub-modules that constitute whole system: 
* on-chain contracts
* beacon chain validators balance
* validator nodes

That means that there is a need for trusted party to provide the following:
1. Providing beacon chain balance changes due to either Ether earned or slashed.
2. Managing validator nodes - making sure of their liveliness, creating and destroying them on demand.
3. Reporting on the state of whole system on-chain.

The team plans to introduce proper admin security measures by using a multisig Timelock contract with 7 days transaction execution delay period as a security measure, which gives very high level of confidence and time to react to the users. Still, some of the risks have to be pointed out in case that the security landscape doesn't meet the expectations or is changed. 

1. Faulty Configuration:
A faulty configuration refers to the scenario where any of the parameters are set to values that could potentially harm users. These parameters are vital settings within the system, and if configured incorrectly, they might lead to unintended consequences, jeopardizing the integrity and security of **StakingTogether**. The most important config parameters that ad admin can change are:
* `Router.Config` - admin can prevent execution of any report via changing `config.oracleQuorum` to higher number than the current oracles count, making any report unprocessable.
* `Router.lastExecutedEpoch` - by changing `lastExecutedEpoch` between report submission and execution, admin can make the report invalid. If the value is set to max possible value - uint256.max - no other report could be created.
* `StakeTogether.Config` - the parameters have the biggest criticality for the user. Those impact how much deposit and withdrawal limit is imposed daily and what most important to the user what's the `minWithdrawAmount`. Setting this value very high means that all the users that deposited smaller value than that are unable to retrieve their funds.

2. Pausing the Contracts Forever:
Pausing the contracts indefinitely is a serious risk that could disrupt the normal operation of the system. **StakeTogether** introduces additional possibility to disable features like deposits of withdrawals apart from pausing whole protocol. If a malicious actor gains control and pauses the contracts permanently, it could prevent users from staking or withdrawing their assets. This situation could cause significant financial losses and erode trust in the platform.

3. Forged Oracle Reports:
Oracle reports are crucial for providing accurate external data to the system. If these reports are forged or manipulated, the information used for decision-making within the protocol becomes unreliable. This could result in incorrect staking rewards, penalties, or other financial calculations, leading to unfair outcomes for users.

4. Withdrawals not executed by off-chain agent:
If withdrawals are not properly executed by the off-chain agent, users may face delays or denial of retrieving their funds. A breakdown in the withdrawal process could cause inconvenience and financial losses for users who depend on timely access to their staked assets.

5. Failing to provide proper validator operational status, leading to mass slashing:
Ensuring the proper operational status of validators is crucial for the security of the network. If there are failures in monitoring and maintaining validators, it could lead to mass slashing events. Mass slashing involves a significant reduction in the staked assets of validators due to their improper behavior or downtime. Such incidents can undermine the network's security and user trust.

## Resolution:
Fixed


## [L-02] Architectural risks
# Architectural Risks
**StakingTogether** architecture consists of both on-chain contracts and off-chain validator nodes and their managers. Current StakeTogether architecture is shown in the following diagram:
![image](https://github.com/sensesecurity/staketogether/assets/12045048/1f5b7def-e750-4452-91de-a1ce0a795b65)

We identified following architectural risks associated with the protocol design:
1. Operating and maintaining validators
The project relies on **SSV.Network** for running validator nodes and utilizes its own servers as a backup in case of issues with SSV or validator withdrawal.

2. Managing SSV tokens balance
As outlined in the [SSV documentation](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/stakers/clusters/cluster-balance), SSV tokens are required as payment for the operator service. The project will manage the balance of SSV tokens via an off-chain multi-sig process, ensuring clusters are topped up with SSV tokens. Failure to maintain a surplus balance of tokens may result in liquidation, closure of validators, and mass slashing events.

3. Potential Outages of SSV Nodes
While SSV nodes are distributed across multiple operators, minimizing the risk of outages, it's challenging to assess the likelihood of this event occurring in real life. StakeTogether employs a strategy of distributing validators across various operators, enhancing positive redundancy and mitigating this risk to some extent.

4. Validator off-boarding and transition period
When a validator is offboarded, such as during stake withdrawal, SSV mandates that stakers maintain the validator active during the transition period to prevent slashing events. StakeTogether is prepared for these situations by operating its own servers, which can assume the validator's responsibility if necessary. However, there is a risk associated with this process - improper switching between nodes may lead to double attestation issues. A recent incident with Lido validators ([Lido double attestation slashing](https://blog.lido.fi/post-mortem-launchnodes-slashing-incident)) serves as a cautionary example. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to conduct emergency switchover tests on the testnet periodically, verifying the correctness of failover procedures.

5. Lengthy Withdrawal Process
Withdrawing funds from the validator is a time-consuming process, currently taking up to a week. [Ethereum Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/withdrawals) provides further information on this process. The withdrawal time may be however increased to unpredictable period, given the formula used for withdrawal processing. Only 16384 non-withdrawal validator accounts or 16 withdrawal accounts requests per block are processed - whichever happens first. In case of a black swan event many validators may decide to withdraw their stake, meaning that the withdrawal time may increase up to 1000x times, freezing user funds for extended period of time.

## [L-03] addToAntiFraudList can be front-run by a user in order to avoid getting their funds lock
## Links:

## Type of Issue:
Front-running

## Description:
A user to be blacklisted can front-run the blacklisting transaction and move funds to any other account. The idea here is that a user can detect that a transaction was created adding them to the `antiFraudList`. They could then front-run this transaction and move all of their funds to another wallet.


Allowing them to have access to their funds still.
Below is the function adding a user to the `antiFraudList`.

```javascript
 /// @notice Adds an address to the anti-fraud list.
  /// @dev Only a user with the ANTI_FRAUD_SENTINEL_ROLE or ANTI_FRAUD_MANAGER_ROLE can add addresses.
  /// @param _account The address to be added to the anti-fraud list.
  function addToAntiFraud(address _account) external {
    if (!hasRole(ANTI_FRAUD_SENTINEL_ROLE, msg.sender) && !hasRole(ANTI_FRAUD_MANAGER_ROLE, msg.sender))
      revert NotAuthorized();
    if (_account == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    antiFraudList[_account] = true;
    emit SetAntiFraudStatus(msg.sender, _account, true);
  }
```
As you can see the `transfer` function here revert is a the msg.sender is on the list. Users can send their funds to a new address that isn't on the list and circumvent this feature. 

```javascript
  /// @notice Transfers an amount of wei to the specified address.
  /// @param _to The address to transfer to.
  /// @param _amount The amount to be transferred.
  /// @return True if the transfer was successful.
  function transfer(
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount
  ) public override(ERC20Upgradeable, IStakeTogether) returns (bool) {
    if (isListedInAntiFraud(msg.sender)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    if (isListedInAntiFraud(_to)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    return true;
  }

  /// @notice Transfers tokens from one address to another using an allowance mechanism.
  /// @param _from Address to transfer from.
  /// @param _to Address to transfer to.
  /// @param _amount Amount of tokens to transfer.
  /// @return A boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
  function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount
  ) public override(ERC20Upgradeable, IStakeTogether) returns (bool) {
    if (isListedInAntiFraud(_from)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    if (isListedInAntiFraud(_to)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    _spendAllowance(_from, msg.sender, _amount);
    _transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
    return true;
  }
```

## [L-04] removeValidators doesn't actually do anything except emit an event 
## Links:

## Type of Issue:
Informational

## Description:
The `removeValidators` function accepts an array of `_publicKeys` and solely emits an event. However, it fails to update the `validators` mapping for the specified `_publicKeys` by setting them to `false`. I assume there are some offchain component listing to the event and then taking the proper steps to remove the Validator. 

## Impact:
As a consequence of this oversight, the `validators` mapping will incorrectly indicate `true` for validators that have been removed using the `removeValidators` function.

## Recommendations:
To address this issue, it is advisable to update the `validators` mapping within the `removeValidators` function and set the corresponding values to `false`. This will ensure that the mapping accurately reflects the status of removed validators.

The Fix:

```diff
  /// @notice Removes validators by their public keys.
  /// @param _publicKeys The public keys of the validators to be removed.
  function removeValidators(
    bytes[] calldata _publicKeys
  ) external onlyRole(VALIDATOR_MANAGER_ROLE) whenNotPaused {

+    validators[_publicKey] = false;
    emit RemoveValidators(_publicKeys);
  }

## Type of Issue:
Centralization

## Description:
Pausable design patterns may protect against hacks, however, if designed improperly or an admin account is compromised, may also harm the users. In the case of StakeTogether, all inflows and outflows are gated behind this pattern, which means that in case any of the contracts holding users' money is paused, they are unable to withdraw anything. Additionally, withdrawals can be disabled by the admin. In case of losing admin power, either by faulty update overriding the admin account or losing private keys, a paused contract will keep user funds forever.

## Impact:
Users may lose all their deposited funds forever if the contract is paused or withdrawals are disabled.

## Recommendations:
We propose to create an emergency funds withdrawal that is only active when the contract is paused or the withdrawal feature is disabled and every withdrawal has to wait in the processing for some time. This will protect against hacks because it will leave the protocol time to act in case of a hack, and it will protect users from locking their funds forever.

Another solution is to use a multi-sig wallet as the admin wallet to help mitigate centralization risks.

## Resolution:
Risk of a pauseable contract, in the worst-case scenario to upgrade the contract.

## [L-06] Unauthorized Token Transfer Vulnerability in `transferFrom` function, Even When `msg.sender` Is Listed in `isListedInAntiFraud`
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L207-L211

## Type of Issue:
Logical

## Description:
The `transferFrom()` function includes checks to ensure that neither the sender (`_from`) nor the receiver (`_to`) is listed in the AntiFraud list before proceeding with the token transfer. However, there is an oversight in the code, as it does not verify whether the `msg.sender` (the function caller) is listed in the AntiFraud list.

This omission could potentially lead to unauthorized token transfers. Although the impact of this vulnerability may not be immediately obvious, it opens a door for potential exploitation by an attacker. Without adequate validation of the function caller (`msg.sender`), an attacker could leverage this vulnerability for some other attack

## Impact:
Users included in the AntiFraud list have the capability to engage with the `transferFrom` function and initiate token transfers.

## POC:
```javascript
it('should fail but passes transferFrom when msg.sender is in anti-fraud list of StakeTogether', async function () {
      const mintAmount = ethers.parseEther('10')
      await mockStakeTogether.connect(owner).mintWithdrawals(user1.address, mintAmount)

      // Approve the transfer amount
      const transferAmount = ethers.parseEther('5')
      await withdrawals.connect(user1).approve(user2.address, transferAmount)

      // Add user3 to the anti-fraud list
      const ANTI_FRAUD_SENTINEL_ROLE = await stakeTogether.ANTI_FRAUD_SENTINEL_ROLE()
      await mockStakeTogether.connect(owner).grantRole(ANTI_FRAUD_SENTINEL_ROLE, owner.address)
      await mockStakeTogether.connect(owner).addToAntiFraud(user2.address)

      // Expect transferFrom to fail
      await withdrawals.connect(user2).transferFrom(user1.address, user3.address, transferAmount),
      expect(await withdrawals.balanceOf(user3.address)).to.equal(transferAmount)

    })
```

## Recommendations:
it is recommended to add an additional check to verify whether the msg.sender is listed in the "AntiFraud" system. 

The Fix:

```diff

 /// @notice Transfers tokens from one address to another using an allowance mechanism.
  /// @param _from Address to transfer from.
  /// @param _to Address to transfer to.
  /// @param _amount Amount of tokens to transfer.
  /// @return A boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
  function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount
  ) public override(ERC20Upgradeable, IStakeTogether) returns (bool) {
    if (isListedInAntiFraud(_from)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    if (isListedInAntiFraud(_to)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
+  if (isListedInAntiFraud(msg.sender)) revert ListedInAntiFraud();
    _spendAllowance(_from, msg.sender, _amount);
    _transfer(_from, _to, _amount);
    return true;

## [L-07] Admin can invalidate any oracle report by setting `lastExecutedEpoch` to value bigger than current
## Links:

## Type of Issue:

Centralization risk

## Description:

When oracles submit their reports, the report epoch is checked in Router.isReadyToSubmit():

```javascript
if (_report.epoch <= lastExecutedEpoch) revert EpochShouldBeGreater();
```

In case it's smaller than currently executed, the report will fail. Currently, the admin has special privileges to change it at will:

```javascript
function setLastExecutedEpoch(uint256 _epoch) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
    lastExecutedEpoch = _epoch;
    emit SetLastExecutedEpoch(_epoch);
}

```
## Recommendations:

Apart from this leading to the invalidation of any Oracle report, I don't see any added value in having this ability for the admin to set it like that. It is updated each time that the report is executed, and there is still an optimistic period between report proposal and execution during which the protocol may overthrow malicious reports.

## [L-08] `currentOracleIndex` may point to nonexistent oracle if the validator oracle is removed
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L572-L575

## Type of Issue:
Off-by-one logical bug

## Description:
When a validator is added or removed by the validator oracle, contract appoints new oracle to handle next such operation by internally calling `StakeTogether._nextValidatorOracle()`:
```solidity
  function _nextValidatorOracle() private {
    currentOracleIndex = (currentOracleIndex + 1) % validatorsOracle.length;
    emit NextValidatorOracle(currentOracleIndex, validatorsOracle[currentOracleIndex]);
  }
```

The issue arises when an oracle with id `validatorsOracle.length + 1` (last in `validatorsOracle` array) is appointed by the function and it is removed from `validatorsOracle` array. Adding a new validator now becomes impossible until `forceNextValidatorOracle()` is called by the oracle sentinel or oracle manager.

## Impact:
This issue temporarily freezes validator oracle operations and may lead to some amount of yield lost due to capital not being turned into a new validator running on becaon chain. It is minimized by the fact that such an edge case should not happen often.

## POC:
1. There are 3 validator oracles added to `validatorsOracle` array.
2. `StakeTogether` contract gathered enough Ether to create 2 validators, so `StakeTogether.addValidator()` is called by appointed oracle twice. This also updates `currentOracleIndex` storage variable.
3. `StakeTogether.removeValidatorOracle()` is called to remove last oracle. `currentOracleIndex` is not updated in this functions, leading to the index pointing to an oracle index that does not exist. Only priviledged account intervention can fix it, when he calls `StakeTogether.forceNextValidatorOracle()`.

## Recommendations:
Consider calling `_nextValidatorOracle()` when adding or removing validator oracles, to prevent this issue from happening.

## Resolution:

## [L-09] StakeTogether.initialize() needlessly initializes critical  storage variables 
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L112

## Type of Issue:
Initialization

## Description:
During the initialization phase of StakeTogether, certain critical storage variables are set to their default values, which is unnecessary since variables in Solidity are initialized to zero by default:
```
    totalShares = 0;
    beaconBalance = 0;
    withdrawBalance = 0;
    currentOracleIndex = 0;
```

## Recommendations:

It's advisable to avoid initializing these variables to zero, as they inherently default to this state. This would prevent potential issues during future contract upgrades as well.

## Resolution:
Admin config error, we are aware.

## [L-10] Possible extra funds lost if StakeTogether fee address is not set 
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/06746c55eaabbb2467bc57dbf3b33c6f7a5b266a/contracts/StakeTogether.sol#L714

## Type of Issue:
Initialization

## Description:
The function `StakeTogether.setFeeAddress()` is the only method to assign fee addresses:
```javascript
function setFeeAddress(FeeRole _role, address payable _address) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
  if (_address == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
  feesRole[_role] = _address;
  emit SetFeeAddress(_role, _address);
}
```
In the fee distribution logic, there's a gap between deployment and the setting of fee addresses. Since all contracts reference `StakeTogether` for fee addresses, if not set, this could result in significant losses due to all fee addresses defaulting to zero address:
```javascript
function _distributeFees(FeeType _feeType, uint256 _sharesAmount, address _to) private {
  // ... logic to calculate and allocate fee shares
}
```
There's an allocation process that happens when `_distributeFees` is called, but without proper fee address initialization, the distribution could fail or result in lost fees.

## Recommendations:

Ensure all fee addresses are set during the deployment transaction by calling `setFeeAddress` immediately after deployment. Alternatively, initializing these addresses in the constructor ensures they are set upon contract creation.

## [L-11] `IStakeTogether.Config` `minDepositAmount` and `minWithdrawalAmount` can be set arbitrarily high

## Description:

IStakeTogether.Config `minDepositAmount` and `minWithdrawalAmount` can be set arbitrarily high and lock user funds in the contract. 

```javascript
  function setConfig(Config memory _config) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (_config.poolSize < config.validatorSize) revert InvalidSize();
    config = _config;
    emit SetConfig(_config);
  }
```

## Impact:

This could lead to a centralization risk as a user can deposit into the contract and the admin could then set the minimal withdrawal amount to a high number leaving users locked out of their funds. The risk of this being exploited is relatively low since it involved compromised admin keys however setting some upper bounds for these variables could mitigate this attack.


## Recommendations:

Set upper bounds for these variables to avoid locking users' funds if they're set too high.

## [L-12] Attacker can front run the owner to mint shares with an inflated rate
## Links:

## Type of Issue:
MEV

## Description:
The `StakeTogether` contract contains an issue in its initialization process due to the minting of 1 ether worth of shares to itself to safeguard against inflation attacks. The owner is expected to send 1 ether to the contract post-deployment to set the exchange rate at 1:1. However, this process is not atomic and is susceptible to a race condition. An attacker can observe the contract deployment and send 1 wei to the contract before the owner's transaction. The attacker can then call the minting function, which would result in a low share price due to the disproportionate ratio of totalShares (1e18) to totalSupply (1 wei). When the owner's 1 ether transaction is confirmed, the total supply increases, and the attacker can either withdraw 1 ether with a massive profit, as the shares were minted at a low rate, or he can keep his funds and get more rewards than all the other stakers.

## Impact:
This issue can lead to immediate loss for the contract owner if the attacker withdraws the ether sent by the owner. Moreover, if the attacker chooses not to withdraw, they will hold a significant portion of the shares minted at a low rate, which will entitle them to an unfairly large portion of the rewards distributed by the protocol. This could severely impact the fair distribution of staking rewards and undermine the economic model of the protocol.

## POC:
### Attack steps
1. Attacker monitors the blockchain for the deployment of the `StakeTogether` contract.
2. Upon detecting the deployment, the attacker sends 1 wei to the contract's address then calls the deposit function, which mints shares at an exchange rate based on the current total supply (1 wei) and total shares (1e18) before the owner's 1 ether transaction is confirmed.
3. Once the owner's transaction of 1 ether is confirmed, the total supply corrects the rate, but the attacker's previously minted shares were minted at a low rate.
4. The attacker can now withdraw 1 ether or retain the shares to receive a disproportionate amount of future rewards.

**Note:** To run the PoC the following line needs to be commented as it is the owner's transaction that we are front-running.

## Recommendations:
- Modify the `totalSupply` function to account for the dead shares minted during the initialization phase. Since these shares are permanently locked within the contract and are not meant to be redeemable or to represent any underlying value, there is no necessity to back these dead shares with ether.
```diff
+    ONE_ETHER = 1e18;
```
```diff
  function totalSupply() public view override(ERC20Upgradeable, IStakeTogether) returns (uint256) {
-     return address(this).balance + beaconBalance - withdrawBalance;
+    return address(this).balance + beaconBalance - withdrawBalance + ONE_ETHER ;
  }
```
## Resolution:
If the admin makes a mistake when deploying the contract, changing the order with specific configurations, the number of shares minted could be greater than expected. In this case, we implemented a minimum total supply value of 1 ether, which prevents this situation from happening, even if the admin makes a configuration error.



## [Q/A] - Redundant checks: `nonReentrant` modifier
## Links:
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/Airdrop.sol#L72-L74
https://github.com/staketogether/st-v1-contracts/blob/b46388cd86d75ad07a7bd1f32fca551f04c86baf/contracts/Airdrop.sol#L113-L118

## Type of Issue:
Redundant Function Check

## Description:
In this instance, the receive() function and the addMerkleRoot() function in the Airdrop.sol file do not call any other function. Thus using the `nonReentrant` modifier is not needed.

## Impact:
Unnecessary checks still consume gas.

## Recommendations:
Removing the `nonReentrant` modifier from functions that do not make external calls is recommended.

## Resolution:
Fixed
